Software I find helpful, and/or use daily on my W530:

Operating System (and Kernel)
  - Gentoo Linux
  - I have used Void Linux, Arch Linux, Ubuntu, and OpenBSD in the past, of the 4 Void and OpenBSD I still use.
General OS usage
  - st, the simple terminal, from suckless
  - dwm
  - startx and wpa_supplicant
Shell
  - the MirBSD Korn Shell
Text Editor
  - Neovim
  - I tried GNU Emacs but it's way too sophisticated for me.
