  Shell Script Ideas

Mkfolder - Asks for the directory to 'cd' into. then you type in a name + enter to make a folder, or q to quit.
Backup - copies folders specified in config file to a 'backup-x/x/2020' folder, name made via 'date' command
Info - Gets distro name, basically just Neofetch
Randowall - Lists possible themes, then switches wallpaper to: (theme) or (random)

  More to come! (Hopefully)
