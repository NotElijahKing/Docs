		Greetings !

	Here I will list ideas for possible scripts that I could make. At the current time,
the only shell script I have written is colorset, which merges a colorscheme (from a directory).

	Basic
- system info
- 1337 h4xx0r script that makes my workspace look like I am hacking the gov't or something
- 
	Intermediate
- themeset - more fancy version of colorset which also sets wallpaper
- something to automate suckless builds (make patch directory, apply patches, auto build and install)
- 
	Advanced
- a system setup script that fetches suckless tools and others based on distro (arch,void,gentoo)
-
