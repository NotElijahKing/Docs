In st and other suckless programs, there is no graphical way to set fonts.
I in particular have went through a small amount of trouble finding what works.
Here's a nice list.


Works:
Source Code Pro
Gohu Gohufont
xos4 Terminus
DEC Terminal
Fira Code (+ Retina)
Bitstream Charter works, but is not monospaced and is a bit odd.
Bitstream Terminal is an absolute mess.

Hack is unimpressive but it does work.

Does NOT work:
Inconsolata


Not sure:
Hack Nerd Font Mono
FiraCode (with no options)


I have yet to try:
Any other Adobe fonts. Fsck off.
Any bold font ( could potentially be causing some problems ) 
Monoid. I have it downloaded
